# Hearthstone API

By requesting all data from the API, I was able to insert all json data to my database and use it for a filter system.

I decided to start this project because I love the game. I'm always excited about the API's that support the games I've played.

# Changelog
Version 1.0

- Added all cards to database
- Filter by card-name
- Loads in all normal images
- Gold cards are available
